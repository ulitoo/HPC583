* -> TEST 
-* get functions in a separate file
-* Consolidate Main in 1 files
-* compile both func and main file

-* avoid file writing

-* get seed as a parameter to be consistent with different trials -> same matrix
-* machine epsilon for double is : 2.22045e-16

-* work on the Error functions

-*GET the data into a File in C++
-*Then read the file in Python
-*Use MATPLOTLIB in python

* -> BREAK MATRICES to test Stability

-* Singular
-* Get a matrix row and replace another row with the same +/- 3epsilon
-* Scale the diagonal
-* Hole in diagonal
